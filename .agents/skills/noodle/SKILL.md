  Operate the Noodle CLI — explain commands, find flags, create/edit .noodle.toml config.
  Also covers writing skills for Noodle: the orders pipeline, task-type schedule fields,
  stage composition, and the orders-next.json schema. Use when running noodle commands,
  editing .noodle.toml, writing or updating a skill's schedule field, authoring new
  task-type skills, or asking "how to run noodle", "noodle help", "configure noodle".

# Noodle

Skills that run themselves. Write skills with a `schedule:` field describing when they should run. Noodle's scheduler agent reads those descriptions, writes orders, and the loop spawns agents in isolated worktrees to do the work.

## How the Loop Works

1. **Brief** — Noodle gathers project state into `.noodle/mise.json` (backlog, active agents, history, capacity, registered skills)
2. **Schedule** — the scheduler agent reads mise, writes `.noodle/orders-next.json`
3. **Dispatch** — Noodle promotes orders and spawns agent sessions
4. **Execute** — each agent runs in its own worktree with the assigned skill
5. **Merge** — completed work merges back to main

## Skills

A skill is a directory with a `SKILL.md`. The body is the agent's instructions. The frontmatter is metadata.

**General skills** (no `schedule:`) are invoked directly by agents. Examples: `commit`, `worktree`.

**Scheduled skills** (with `schedule:`) run autonomously. The scheduler reads the `schedule:` value as prose and uses judgment to decide when conditions are met.

```yaml
---
name: quality
description: Post-cook quality gate.
schedule: "Follow-up stage after execute. Cross-provider review preferred."
---
```

Skills live in `.agents/skills/` by default. Paths in `skills.paths` are searched in order; first match wins.

## Configuration

Noodle reads `.noodle.toml` at project root. Scaffolded on first `shinfactory start`. Most projects only need:

```toml
mode = "supervised"  # auto | supervised | manual

[routing.defaults]
provider = "claude"
model = "claude-sonnet-5-5"

[routing.roles]  # optional: model per role (scheduler, planner, builder, ...)
planner = { provider = "claude", model = "claude-opus-5-5" }

[skills]
paths = [".agents/skills"]
```

## CLI

All commands accept `--project-dir` (default: current directory, env: `NOODLE_PROJECT_DIR`).

### Core

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `shinfactory start` | Start the noodle loop |
| `shinfactory start --once` | Run one scheduling cycle and exit |
| `shinfactory status` | Show runtime status (active agents, queue depth, loop state) |
| `shinfactory reset` | Clear all runtime state (refuses if loop is running) |

### Skills & Schemas

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `shinfactory skills` | List resolved skills |
| `shinfactory skills list` | List all resolved skills |
| `shinfactory schema <target>` | Print schema docs for a target |
| `shinfactory schema list` | List available schema targets (`mise`, `orders`, `status`) |

### Worktrees

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `shinfactory worktree create <name>` | Create a new linked worktree |
| `shinfactory worktree create <name> --from <ref>` | Create from a specific branch or commit |
| `shinfactory worktree exec <name> <command...>` | Run a command inside a worktree (CWD-safe) |
| `shinfactory worktree merge <name>` | Merge a worktree branch into integration branch |
| `shinfactory worktree merge <name> --into <branch>` | Merge into a specific target branch |
| `shinfactory worktree list` | List all worktrees with merge status |
| `shinfactory worktree prune` | Remove merged and patch-equivalent worktrees |
| `shinfactory worktree cleanup <name>` | Remove a worktree without merging |
| `shinfactory worktree cleanup <name> --force` | Remove even with unmerged commits |
| `shinfactory worktree hook` | Run worktree session hook (used internally) |

### Events

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `shinfactory event emit <type>` | Emit an external event into the loop |
| `shinfactory event emit <type> --payload <json>` | Emit with a JSON payload |
| `shinfactory event emit <type> --session <id>` | Emit to a specific session's event log |

## Troubleshooting

1. **"fatal config diagnostics prevent start"** — Check `.noodle.toml` against `shinfactory schema`.
2. **Missing adapter scripts** — Create scripts or update paths in config.
3. **Stale worktrees** — `shinfactory worktree list`, then `shinfactory worktree prune`.
